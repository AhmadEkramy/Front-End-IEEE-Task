Arrays: Its size cannot be changed, you can acess it by index.
Strings: Its a array of chars and it also can be acess it by index.
Linked lists: Its a dynamic data structure that store elements in nodes that are connected by links using pointers.(It is not fixed like array so you can change its size).
